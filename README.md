# DUX

Dux is an web app developed for a group of Unilasalle students on their second - fourth period.

The idea of the app is use an bus API to follow the bus line desired by the user and them tells he by sound where (in meters) the bus is.

The app is developed using Javascript, CSS and HTML. 

The Rio de Janeiro bus API that we were initially using is no longer available.
